We are glad to welcome all NodeJS developers who want to improve their professional skills.
The Ubikiri project is looking for active NodeJS contributors willing to support and develop our project.
The Ubikiri platform is made for business and professional people who are ready to implement the most ambitious business ideas and concepts. Our distributed social network can give the possibility to enter into contracts, confirm information of any type. It allows you to adjust the amount of information provided about yourself for each transaction.
Our platform Chain-in-law is an OPEN-SORCE project. CiL (Chain-in-Law) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and has great advantages in terms of speed and scalability. The platform is fully public and open. The code is available to any member on our GitHub page (https://github.com/SilentNotaryEcosystem/Cil-core). 
You can use the code placed there in open access to create your own decentralized applications, as well as to develop segments of the platform itself. 
Please note that the platform code is written in Node JS, a JavaScript smart contract language with some limitations. In fact, our proposal is unique for developers working with these languages. The project alone will enable JS developers to get into the "heart" of the blockchain and crypto technologies without changing the programming language.
1. You have the opportunity to “look under the hood” of a really unique project built on the blockchain Chain-in-Law (CiL) and written on Node JS.
-   Ubikiri is an expansion of horizons for advanced developers.
-  For beginners - this is a huge new layer of knowledge and experience.
2. You can have full freedom of action.
-  You can work and decompose by solving problems according to our sections.
-  At the same time, all your wildest ideas, interesting and useful software solutions will be considered and rewarded.
3. We are ready for cooperation at different levels:
-  Full-time - you understand the project from the inside and you are ready to solve complex and non-standard tasks. The project developers assess your qualification, we make you an offer and add motivation.
-  Part-time - you take different "parts" of tasks and give out "pieces" of their solutions.
-  Hackathon format - several developers do a collective task and offer a solution.
4. The payment for contributions are made in the tokens of the project Ubikiri (CiL). There is a possibility of their swapping to the tokens of the basic Silent Notary project (SNTR), which was stable during the period of a general fall in the market and is listed in the main cryptoexchanges. Our tokens has icreased by more than a double-digit percentage over the last month. We are in the post-ICO period and continue to grow rapidly. The project has been working for more than a year, we have already working platforms and a name on the market - the reliability and prospects of the token are confirmed by a large and active community of holders and traders that are working with the crypto component of the project.

5. You also have the opportunity among the first to "deploy" your node/masternode for receiving passive income in the process of our blockchain Chain-in-Law functioning. This will require a certain number of tokens, which is quite possible to purchase or earn under this program.
Here is the list of so-called "work sections":
- The finalization of the language of smart contracts (this is either JS with AST or webassembly).
- Thr improvement of the network stability mechanisms: the consilium participants or the whole consilium "punishment" for misbehave.
- The additional rules of creation/validation for consiliums (this is PoS, PoW, etc.).
- The security audit. The network vulnerability to various attacks.
- The dependencies audit (the packages used in the project for vulnerabilities. The using packages with fewer dependencies).
- The aggregated signatures under the block. The evaluation of the creating blocks mechanism of vulnerability to fingerprinting (many signatures from witnesses under the blocks - will it be possible to restore the witnesses' private keys with these signatures)?
- The sharding in order to increase the number of transactions processed by the network.
