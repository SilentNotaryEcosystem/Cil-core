## Node install for development net
Set the environment variable `NODE_ENV=Devel`.

To display debug information, you must set a variable `DEBUG=peer:*,node:*`.

In components that support debugging at the beginning of the file there is a tag that is used for debugging.

Example (Linux):
```
NODE_ENV=Devel DEBUG=peer:*,node:* node index.js
```
## Testing
#### Running tests
```npm test```
#### Running tests with debug output (*nix)
```npm run-script testDebugNix```
#### Running tests with debug output (Windows)
```npm run-script testDebugWin```
